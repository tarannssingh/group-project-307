# Project Blurb
PiggyPass is a password manager for internet users who struggle to remember passwords or donâ€™t want to risk their accounts getting attacked. 
<br /><br />
PiggyPass securely keeps track of username and passwords with 2 factor authentication, database password encryption, and a secure user interface. It offers a centralized location to store passwords and an easy way to search through them. Users can also generate a secure password that meet standard password requirements.
